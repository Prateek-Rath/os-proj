entities needed:
user data
book data
admin data


user:
id primary key
username // must be unique
name
password
phone

admin:
id primary key
username // must be unique
name
password
phone number


book:
title
author
copies left
owner -- userid or -1(if it is in library)


if someone buys the book, remove it from the library


relationships:
borrows // M:N

locks and semaphores and stuff:
when someone is borrowing/returning, no one else can edit books or do any such thing
when someone is editing books no one else can do anything else
so we have only exclusive locks

sockets are needed to access the server functionality. the server holds all the databases and only way to access that should be through server.c
whatever client wants is sent to server, server processes and then replies and then waits for input from client...


login and register functionality needs to be there









//todo: 

//communication protocols

//generic.c --later


//implement commands and make server send back stuff
